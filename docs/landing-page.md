# Welcome to OPS705 - Introduction to Cloud Computing

## What This Course is About

Over the last several years, infrastructure and applications have become more and more reliant on operating in the cloud. These days, you're more likely to develop a responsive web application directly on cloud services instead of locally. This course will introduce you to the basic concepts of working and developing in and for the cloud.


  - You will play the part of a system administrator, responsible for installing, configuring, adjusting, maintaining, and troubleshooting the operation of a development environment. This is a lot of responsibility, and with that responsibility comes power. You will be able to change anything on the system, and you will also have the ability to damage or destroy the system.
  - You will learn how to develop and deploy applications on various cloud environments, from a simple container-like setup with a few clicks to a complicated multi-server application with database support.
  - This course will give you hands-on experience with two major cloud computing services: **Microsoft Azure** and **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

## Learning by Doing

Most of the learning in this course occurs through the hands-on problem solving that takes place in the assigned labs and two assignments.

**Requirements for Success:**

  - **It is very important to stay up-to-date with the coursework, and to practice until you have confidently mastered each task.**
  - All of the software used in this course is _open source_ software where possible, so you are free to use, modify, and redistribute it. This means that you can install it as many times as you want on as many different computers as you would like. It also means that you can tinker with it -- you can take it apart, see how it works, and put it back together in the same or a different way, limited only by your time and ambition. You are encouraged to experiment and question liberally.
  - **The notes that you make during the labs and assignments are your reference material for the quizzes, tests, and assignments.** Take really good notes, and if you have questions, experiment and consult with your professor.
  - **Carefully read ALL lab instructions and check your work regularly.** The labs have been designed to give you hands-on experience and are built with step-by-step instructions. Don't skip instructions, but also be careful not to coast through a lab.
  - **Take the time to *understand* what the lab instructions are asking you to do.** These labs are a learning tool, not just a way to get marks in the course.

## Required Materials

1. **Your Seneca-based Credentials** (username and password).
3. **USB Flash Drive** and/or **Secure Online Storage** for document and key backups.
4. [OPS705 Lab Logbook - Azure](/files/azure-logbook.docx) A downloadable Word document. This should be filled out as you complete a lab. You can print this out and bring it to all quizzes and tests.

 
      - **NOTE: If you've taken this class in a previous semester, you MAY NOT bring that version of the lab logbook to any testing.**
